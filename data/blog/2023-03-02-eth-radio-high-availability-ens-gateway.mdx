### **What is ETH.Radio?**

![](/static/images/old-blog/1_t2iPM3eOvbK1eUDtaHi8ZQ.gif)

[ETH.Radio](https://eth.radio/) is a high-availability Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gateway. It represents a significant step towards the adoption of the decentralized web (dweb) by offering a new way to access ENS resolvable domains. Prior to the launch of ETH.Radio, services such as Cloudflare’s eth.link and the community-driven eth.limo were the primary means of bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3.

With ETH.Radio, users can access ENS domains through a reliable and decentralized gateway that provides an alternative to the centralized services offered by other providers. By leveraging the power of IPFS and ENS, ETH.Radio enables users to access content and services hosted on the dweb in a more resilient and censorship-resistant manner.

Overall, ETH.Radio is a significant development in the ongoing evolution of the dweb, and it offers users a powerful new tool for accessing the decentralized internet.

- **We are committed to protecting the privacy of our end users**.We do not keep logs of your IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or X-Forwarded-For HTTP headers. This ensures that all request data is fully anonymized.
- Users can expect to enjoy **even faster load times** with the Meson Network’s new, robust infrastructure stack.
- We now offer on-demand ENS **domain certificates**. When you submit an HTTP request for your domain name (e.g. myname.eth.radio), we will automatically attempt to issue the certificate in the background. This means that you can now secure your ENS domain with a certificate, enhancing the security and credibility of your website.
- We provide an **all-in-one deployment tool** that allows you to choose which versions of content to serve before committing fully to an IPFS release. This tool also enables you to easily roll back or fail over in case of a bug or vulnerability.

### **Web3 Brand Enhancement**

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a crucial brand asset in Web3 that should not be overlooked by Web3 practitioners. The ability to access .eth on the internet has further amplified the brand value of ENS.

- **Web3 Website**

Taking Staking Launchpad as an example, users can add an IPFS link to the ENS Content Hash of depositcontract.eth, which enables the [depositcontract.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/depositcontract.eth/details) domain name to directly redirect to the official website.

```
