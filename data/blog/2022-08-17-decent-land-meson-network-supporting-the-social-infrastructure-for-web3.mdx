The web3 social layer [Decent.land](https://www.decent.land/) has recently deployed Meson Network DCDN as the gateway with a custom endpoint URL which provides decentralized caching across over 30,000 nodes. All content aggregated by the **_[weave-aggregator](https://github.com/decentldotland/weave-agg-cache/releases/tag/v0.0.7)_** is being accelerated much better now. Also the ANS resolver web app (ar.page) now uses Meson Network to fetch and parse data from Arweave network.

Meson Network Integration

Decent.land is a set of web3 social protocols for **identity**, **DAO governance** and **social networking**. Built on Arweave, decent.land stores all data on-chain **_immutable_** and **_permanent_**.

> “decent.land stores all data on chain but uses a few helper APIs to faster parse and deliver it to users. With Meson, we are able to improve the performance and decentralisation of these APIs and offer a better experience for users and developers. ”

> _“We’re thrilled to support Decent.land and scale the **web3 infrastructure** with our partners together. It’s been a while in the crypto space to try kinds of solutions for cross-chain. Ark Protocol makes a step for the perception of the data/assets, and we are expected to see more incoming progress.”_

### **About Meson Network**

[Meson Network](https://meson.network/) is building the decentralized bandwidth marketplace for Web3, using a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models, consolidating and monetizing idle bandwidth from long-tail users at a low cost. Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.
