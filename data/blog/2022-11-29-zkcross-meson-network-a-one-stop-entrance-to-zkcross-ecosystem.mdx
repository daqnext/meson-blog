ZKCross is the first Multichain zkRollup execution layer utilizing zkWASM and has officially added Meson Network to its ecosystem as an infrastructure network partner. Meson Powers ZKCross for Cyber Privacy in the Metaverse and accelerate content through Meson’s dCDN which enables the data transmission to be based on complete decentralization, mitigating the risk of trusting centralized CDNs.

Meson Network, the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem will be supported by zkWasm-based multichain support from ZKCross.

The two sides will also carry out more constructive cooperation in these three aspects: Product affiliate recommendation、Joint one-click Solutions、Market Development Fund (MDF).

### **About ZKCross**

**[ZKCross](https://www.zkcross.org/)** is a zk-SNARK-based multichain layer on top of which native multichain applications can run safely and efficiently.

While many existing protocols are designed for specific scenarios, they focus on preserving different properties with various trust bases. ZKCross’ Multichain Aggregator targets to achieve liveness, safety, permissionless, and linearizability properties by using zero-knowledge proof to provide a universal layer to synchronize states between different smart contracts on other blockchains, and this layer, together with its communication protocol, can be used as a multichain native framework.

### **About Meson Network**

**[Meson Network](https://meson.network/)** is building the decentralized bandwidth marketplace for Web3, using a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models, consolidating and monetizing idle bandwidth from long-tail users at a low cost. Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.
