We are thrilled to announce a dynamic collaboration between Meson Network and Push Protocol. This partnership marks a significant step forward in advancing decentralized communication and networking capabilities within the Web3 ecosystem.

This collaboration brings together Push Protocol's expertise in communication with Meson Network's prowess in building robust Web3 infrastructure. Key areas of collaboration include:

**Depin Integration:** Joining forces with Meson Network to actively support the depin project, Push Protocol brings its communication expertise to enhance the overall serviceability and functionality of depin. This collaborative effort aims to provide a more robust and feature-rich environment for depin users.

**Enhanced Communication Capabilities:** Integration of Push Protocol's communication layer into Meson Network's infrastructure, enabling seamless cross-chain notifications and messaging.

**Decentralized Bandwidth Exchange Integration:** Leveraging Push Protocol's capabilities to optimize and enhance the functionality of Meson Network's decentralized bandwidth exchange, creating a more efficient and decentralized networking experience.

Both Push Protocol and Meson Network share a common vision of democratizing access to decentralized communication and networking resources. By combining our strengths, we aim to set new standards for user-centric, secure, and efficient Web3 experiences.

This extended collaboration underscores the commitment of both Push Protocol and Meson Network to elevate depin's capabilities, offering users a sophisticated and decentralized communication platform backed by a robust Web3 infrastructure.

### **About Push Protocol**

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet / frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.
