**OKC (OKX Chain)** is an **EVM-compatible** L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximized performance, and has officially added **Meson Network** as an infrastructure network partner into its ecosystem.

This means that all web3 projects built on OKC can accelerate content through Meson’s dCDN which enables the data transmission to be based on full **decentralization**, mitigating the risk of trusting centralized CDNs.

There are hundreds of Dapps including DeFi, NFTs, GameFi and Wallets running on OKC, they consume massive bandwidth monthly but most are still using centralized CDN bought from traditional vendors. Web3 developers are increasingly worried about relying on centralized infras especially after AWS and Cloudflare went **down** couple of times in 2022.

Due to fully distributed cloud servers and family-owned bandwidth added to Meson network system, Meson dCDN will keep OKC ecosystem Dapps operating stably regardless CDN single points of failure. Meanwhile Meson’s back-to-back algorithm will randomly cache the data to be transmitted to multiple nodes, which has a strong positive effect on content **censorship resistance** too.

Having the Meson Network onboard is another step toward decentralization. With the Meson Network OKC ecosystem projects can accelerate content through Meson’s dCDN, which enables the data transmission to be based on full decentralization, and **easy-to-access Web3**,”_said Lin, OKC (OKX Chain) Ecosystem Development Lead._

### **Upcoming Integration**

Besides offering generous bandwidth traffic to the OKC ecosystem, Meson Network will also deploy on OKC in 2023 as agreed. Mutual parties are working closely to boost decentralized networks used more widely in web3.

### **About OKC (OKX Chain)**

**[OKC](https://www.okx.com/okc) (OKX Chain)** is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximized performance. At high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKC ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.

### **About Meson Network**

**[Meson Network](https://meson.network/)** is building the decentralized bandwidth marketplace for Web3, using a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models, consolidating and monetizing idle bandwidth from long-tail users at a low cost. Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.
