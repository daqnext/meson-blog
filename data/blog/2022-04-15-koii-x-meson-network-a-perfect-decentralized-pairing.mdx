Curious about what’s going on behind the scenes of decentralization? If so, you should pay attention to Koii’s partnership with the Meson Network. Lets dive into the ways these two networks are working together to create the infrastructure needed to truly scale Web3.

Koii Network is focused on building the tools and infrastructure that developers need to create powerful creator-focused dApps. Meson Network is a decentralized CDN (Content Delivery Network) or dCDN for short. The primary role of the network is to utilize idle commercial and third-party bandwidth through blockchain to provide CDN services.

Let’s take a closer look at how these two networks are finding unique ways to solve the challenges faced by decentralization, while also shining a light on its many advantages.

**Taking Web3 to the Next Level With Koii Network**

Some of the primary challenges facing Web3 are poor user experience, the separation of contract and storage layers, and slow application development. The Koii technology stack enables builders to standardize their development process by providing a toolkit that reduces development time by over 90% while remaining fully decentralized. In addition, by using the Koii SDKand Koii-X templates, developers have access to a growing list of cross-chain services while leveraging the unique capabilities of the Koii Network.

## What Makes Koii Unique?

Building with Koii is about more than just streamlining app development. It also provides several unique technological enhancements that aren’t found elsewhere. Taking a closer look at the official Koii Wallet, Finnie, provides us with a window into what the network can do. Finnie is a kind of “super” crypto wallet, enabling users to interact directly with multiple aspects of the network. With Finnie installed, a user can drag and drop files to create Atomic NFTs, which combine media, contract, and storage into one digital asset. These Atomic NFTs generate attention rewards in the form of KOII (Koii Network token) whenever they are viewed, directly rewarding the NFT owner. Atomic NFTs also function as an important building block for dApps, enabling developers to use them in their applications which further expands their utility and value.

As KOII is mined by the attention that Atomic NFTs receive, KOII can be used to pay for other services on the network. This application layer is powered by a network of task nodes that can provide network-based or cross-chain services through Koii DIDs (decentralized IDs).

Koii’s unique attributes, cross-chain functionality, and the potential to generate attention rewards make the network a strong value proposition for developers and creators. Still, no matter how good the technology is, it won’t attract new users if it is slow or cumbersome to use. Koii recently announced K2, a new high-speed settlement layer that is capable of transaction speeds of 2000 tps, accelerating the communications and security of the network and eliminating any concerns about network speed.

## A Perfect Decentralized Pairing

Both Koii and Meson Network are examples of how blockchain and decentralized technology are moving beyond simply matching Web2 capabilities. Their unique approaches and novel technology stacks solve problems while providing services that highlight the advantages of decentralized networks. As networks like Koii build out the tool sets needed to make application development faster and easier, the number of dApps will continue to grow. More dApps means more bandwidth; another reason why Meson Network’s dCDN will be a critical component of Web3 infrastructure.

## About Meson Network

Meson Network is committed to creating an efficient bandwidth marketplace on Web3 by using a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models, consolidating and monetizing idle bandwidth from long-tail users at a low cost. Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.
