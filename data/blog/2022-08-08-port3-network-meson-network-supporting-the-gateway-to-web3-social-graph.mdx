We’re thrilled to announce that [Port3 Network](https://www.port3.io/), the Gateway to Web3 Social Graph, partners with [Meson Network](https://meson.network/) — the bottom-up paradigm in building a bandwidth marketplace, to facilitate both projects and the communities with greater web3 experiences.

Meson Network’s **decentralized CDN** is now supporting Port3 Network to accelerate statics files on their portal much faster and safer, also in the near future Meson will work with Port3 to store all their raw data in the decentralized storages with acceleration support. On the other side, Port3 Network’s SoGraph Dao Tool Bot is providing Meson Network community with more practical functions including in-community smart airdrops, market sentiment & trend watch and gateway to **Web3 social plugins**.

> “In the Web3 age we believe it is all about interconnectivity and IoT, thus we believe our collaboration with Meson Network will be one great partnership. We are looking forward to augmenting our Port3 ecosystem with improved speed and security.”
